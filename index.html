                <p>Since my junior high school years I found myself very engaged in mathematics and problem solving. I was fond of geometry and could spend hours calculating volumes, measuring angles and proving similarity of triangles. At the time of making a decision about my profession and career, the industry was already screaming about immediate need for software engineers and, adding my interest in solving technical challenges, the decision was easy - computer science and programming.
                        Back then C++, Java and DHTML were the languages to choose from. I started with Java and I was amazed how quickly it allows one to build a functional UI application or a backend servlet in a minimal time frame. After a year of intensive learning I started to realize that my preference is in software quality assurance and automated testing of web and mobile applications. Since then the most enjoyable phase during product development for me was after all the ambiguities are resolved and after all the strategies are documented I am all into the coding - writing small programs and scripting tools to materialize and automate all this chain that was responsible for quality, security, reliability and correctness.
                        In the era of cloud and connected devices programming takes a critical role of making things happen at a fast pace. A team of programmers designing, brainstorming and implementing a solution has a power to immediately change lives of people all around the world. Exchanging news and streaming real time data via high-throughput reliable channels, classifying and searching through various contents, predicting diseases and controlling climate change via machine learning, increasing productivity/safety via self-driving cars and a lot of more technologies help us make people more productive and world a safer place. I would be thrilled to become part of what drives these changes and I believe LEAP program is a perfect program to help me in achieving this.
